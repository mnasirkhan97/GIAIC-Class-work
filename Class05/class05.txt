Topics :
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Divid
5. Concatenation
6. Exponentiation : When an exponent is a positive integer, that exponent indicates how many copies of the base are multiplied together.
 For example, 35 = 3 路 3 路 3 路 3 路 3 = 243.

7. Modulus (reminder) : It's the remainder operator and is used to get the remainder after integer division. 
 Lots of languages have it. For example:

10 % 3 // = 1 ; because 3 * 3 gets you 9, and 10 - 9 is 1.

8. Unary Operators : (++), (--) Prefix and postfix operators
Unary Operators work on a single operand and perform various operations, 
like incrementing/decrementing, evaluating data type, negation of a value, etc.


* Post increment : Post-increment operator: A post-increment operator is used to increment the value of a variable 
after executing the expression in which the operator is used. 
With the post-increment operator, the value of the variable is first used in an expression and then incremented. 
Syntax: int x = 10; int a; a = x++;

* Post Decrement: phly return kry ga us k bd value ko subtract (-) kry ga.

* Pre Decrement : Phly value ko subtract kry ga us k bd return kry ga.
